    <h1>PVP tips</h1>
    <ol id="conten">
      <li>Good Enchantments:<br> 
        You cannot really win epic PVP battles without strong enchantments. In most cases, players use diamond or netherite gear. The preferred enchantments are Protection, Fire Protection, Thorns, and Unbreaking. For your swords, the best enchantments are Knockback, Fire Aspect, and Sharpness. <br>

        Since you will surely also use your bow (more on that below), enchant it with Power, Flame, and Infinity.<br>

        You will win more battles in PVP action with better enchantments. </li>
      <li>Take The Fishing Rod To Battle:<br>
        If you only now started PVP-ing in Minecraft, it is quite surprising to see pro players fight with fishing rods. After all, these are meant to catch fish, correct? Yes. But in PVP battles, the rod is very useful. You can take your fishing rod and pull the other player closer.<br>

        The fishing rod is a part of a very useful tactic. You pull in the other player and then you send him/her back with the use of a knockback sword. This allows you to startle your opponent, which can be very beneficial even in close-quarter combat. </li>
      <li>3. Practice To Improve Your Clicking Speed And Aiming
      </li>
      <li>Practice Quick Hotbar Item Switching:<br>
        Many beginners have this huge problem in PVP battles. They find it difficult to switch between potions, food, and weapons. During survival mode, you practice and you become used to making switches between weapons and tools. But, this is not enough to get you ready for a PVP fight with someone that knows how to do this better. </li>
      <li>Master Critical Hitting:<br>
        In the game, if you are in a mid-air position and you move downward, your hits do 50 percent more damage, with one heart extra. These are critical. They also apply a knock back. You know that you hit a player with a critical hit when gray particles appear. <br>


        The problem with critical attacks is that they do not work when you are moving up. Criticals just appear when you are moving down towards a player. The good news is that you can hit a critical with practically anything. This includes blocks, your fist, your sword, and practically anything. You can even do so with your bow. However, with the bow, it needs to be charged to the fullest, and gray particles fly off.</li>
      <li>Final Thoughts:<br>
        Practice and patience are the 2 most important things in Minecraft PVP. It will not be easy to be very good but anyone can get there. Besides the battle tips above, the other things you should know are:<br>
       <ul>
        <li>Get used to running away – If you only have half a heart, even one punch can kill you. This is why you need to get used to running away when you only have 2 or fewer hearts left. Simply turn around by sprinting and jumping. If possible, also hit the opponent as you do this for the extra knock back.</li> 
        <li>Use your environment – Be aware of what is around you. For instance, do you fight on mountains? You can always knock others off a cliff. </li>
         <li>The higher ground is your friend – This will generate those critical hits you want.</li>
        </ul> </li>
      </ol>
