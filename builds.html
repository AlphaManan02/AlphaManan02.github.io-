    <h1>Building Tips</h1>
    <ol id="content">
      <li>Cubes Are So Yesterday:<br>
        While little square huts are great for fending off the nasties in survival mode, you’ll want to go for a bit more pizzazz if you want to make a proper living space. Be sure to add alcoves, hallways and wings to your build. A great way to start using this building tip is by making two cubes adjacent to each other and then connecting them with a narrow hallway.

      <li>Flat Walls Are Sad Walls:<br>
        In real life, walls tend to be a bit of a boring affair. It doesn’t have to be that way with your dream Minecraft home, though. By adding pillars to your walls you can give the rooms of your home more personality. Plus it will feel more Game of Thrones like. We also have a cool post about different walls to hopefully make you build a non-boring one.</li>
      <li>Blueprints, Blueprints Everywhere:<br>
        This probably should be the number 1 building tip as it’s quite a prevalent practice among Minecrafter builders. Before starting any heavy construction, start laying out your design on the ground first. You can do this by digging holes and adding a slab of the block type you will use for each part of your build. This way, you can edit the way your layout turns out before erecting and walls.</li>
      <li>No Party Like A Theme Party:<br>
        It’s nice to start with something blad but ultimately you want to have some kind of theme that influence’s your build’s appearance. Minecraft has a wide array of tools that will allow you to make your home look pretty much any way you want. You can go for a medieval castle, a white picket fence suburban home and everything else in between.</li>
      <li>Follow How-To Build Guides:<br>

        There are a lot of guides to learn how-to build pretty much anything on Minecraft. In this blog we constantly share plenty you can click anywhere in our blog and find one. This Minecraft building tip is the most obvious one but we didn’t want to miss it.<br>

        You can find how to’s tutorials for almost any type of build. One of the most popular ones in our blog is the one about how to build a castle.This guide is one (if not the most) popular building guide we have shared. We actually had a version of the guide that was really liked but we realized the specific Castle that was being built in the tutorial wasn’t as pretty looking as we would have wanted and was also a little too complicated so a few months ago we decided to update the guide to a better version.<br>

        The Castle you would build in this tutorial is simple and easy, but most of the visitors looking at this tutorial were new to Minecraft so if you are building your first castle this guide would be great for you. It might not look like much, but it’s the “setting stone” for an amazing medieval town or whatever you are building that needs castles. Once you are a little more experienced you can keep adding things to the castle.</li>
